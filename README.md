# Natural Language Mapping Pipeline (NLMap)

This is an attempt to convert verbal or textual descriptions of places
into digitally mappable data sets.

I'll start with [electoral boundaries][elb], but can be generalised to
any kind of descriptive map.

The aim is to translate "area bounded by Streets A, B, C, D" to usable
polygons.

I haven't done a thorough search of what's already on the market, so I
might be missing a few obvious options here, but I will update as I go
along.
